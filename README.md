## 🌈 Structural Highlighting

One of Delphi's most recognizable editor features is the structural coloring of nested blocks.

Supported keywords include:

- `begin`
- `end`
- `if`
- `then`
- `else`
- `case`
- `for`
- `while`
- `repeat`
- `until`
- `try`
- `except`
- `finally`
- `raise`
- `break`
- `continue`
- `exit`

| Depth | Color        | Hex       |
| ----- | ------------ | --------- |
| 1     | Red          | `#FA0000` |
| 2     | Orange       | `#FF9900` |
| 3     | Green        | `#59CB33` |
| 4     | Turquoise    | `#00CED1` |
| 5     | Blue         | `#4169E1` |
| 6     | Purple       | `#9B59B6` |

After level 6, the color cycle repeats.

## 🔧 Required Pascal Extension

This theme **requires** a Pascal extension that provides TextMate grammar scopes and language support for `.pas`, `.dpr`, `.dpk`, and `.inc` files. Without it, Pascal files open as plain text and the theme cannot apply any syntax highlighting.

**[Pascal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.pascal)** by Alessandro Fragnani is the recommended extension and the one this theme was developed and tested with.

Also available on [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/alefragnani/pascal) for Kiro IDE and other VS Code-compatible editors.

### Also recommended

- [indent-rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow) — colorizes indentation levels, complementing the structural highlighting

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project is more than a color theme.

It is an effort to reproduce the Delphi IDE editing experience using modern editors such as Visual Studio Code and Kiro IDE, while documenting the language highlighting rules through a specification-driven development approach.

The long-term goal is to provide the Delphi community with a high-quality, well-documented and professionally maintained theme.
